# Graphest

**Graphest** is a graphing calculator that can faithfully plot arbitrary mathematical relations.

## Features

- Plot arbitrary equations/inequalities
- Never gives an incorrect result; if you find a relation that is incorrectly plotted, please [report it here](https://github.com/unageek/graphest/issues/new)
- Cartesian and polar coordinates
- Parametric relations
- Full interactivity
- Extensive set of [mathematical functions](docs/guide/README.adoc)

## Getting Started

The latest version of the app is available on the [releases page](https://github.com/unageek/graphest/releases).

You can try messing around with [example relations](Examples.md).

## [Building from Source](docs/build.md)

## Algorithm

Graphest aims to provide a modern, open-source and extensible alternative to [GrafEq™](http://www.peda.com/grafeq/) program [Ped].

The following algorithms in [Tup01] are implemented: 1.1–3.2, 3.3 (partially), 3.4.1–3.4.3, 3.4.5 (partially).
