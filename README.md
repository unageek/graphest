# Graphest

**Graphest** is a graphing calculator that can faithfully plot arbitrary mathematical relations.

## Getting Started

[Download the app](https://github.com/unageek/graphest/releases) (available for both macOS and Windows), and try plotting some of the [example relations](Examples.md).

## Features

- Plot arbitrary equations/inequalities
- Never gives an incorrect result; if you find any relation plotted incorrectly, please [report it here](https://github.com/unageek/graphest/issues/new)
- Cartesian and polar coordinates
- Parametric relations
- Full interactivity
- Extensive set of [mathematical functions](https://unageek.github.io/graphest/guide/)

## [Building from Source](docs/build.md)

## Algorithm

Graphest aims to provide a modern, open-source and extensible alternative to [GrafEq™](http://www.peda.com/grafeq/) [Ped].

The following algorithms in [Tup01] are implemented: 1.1–3.2, 3.3 (partially), 3.4.1–3.4.3, 3.4.5 (partially).
